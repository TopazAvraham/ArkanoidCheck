## Introduction

This Arkanoid version is the final product of Java OOP course, which I took in the 2nd semester of my 1st year at Bar Ilan University.  
This project was coded as a five-part ongoing assignment, and intead of using Java GUI Built-In objects, I used a GUI implementation which is included in this repository. The game contains various levels with increasing difficulty and was coded while preserving generic and modularity, so adding new levels is an easy task.

The implementation includes:

üí• Polymorphism and inheritance.

üí• Usage of OOP design patterns, such as Decorator, Observer, Builder, etc.

üí• Usage of several generic collections data structures such as Linked Lists, Maps, etc.

üí• User-friendly GUI platform.
