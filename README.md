## Introduction

This arkanoid version is the final product of a 6 months project in Java.
This project was coded as a five-part ongoing assignment on the 2nd semester of my 1st year at Bar Ilan University.
Built-In objects, instead, I used a GUI implementation which is included in this repository.
The game contains various levels with increasing difficulty, in a gui friendly platform.

The implementation includes in general:

💥 Polymorphism and inheritance.

💥 Usage of design patterns in OOP, such as Decorator, Observer, Builder, etc.

💥 Usage of several generic collections and data structures such as linked lists and arraylists.

💥 Working with GUI.
